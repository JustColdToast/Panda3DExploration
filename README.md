# Panda3DExploration
The result of me following a tutorial to learn the Panda3D Framework for 3D Games
There's not much to see here, however I do comment almost everything I did (in an effort to understand the tutorial), so I hope people can find this helpful for better understanding the [Panda3D Hello World Tutorial](https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/introduction/tutorial/index)
